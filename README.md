Visualization_of_Mandelbrot_set.py<br>
this is a script that provides a visualization of the mandel brotset<br>
Latin_hyper_cube.py<br>
this is a script to use the latin hyper cube method in finding the area of the mandelbrot set, including the variance, mean area, confidence interval at a given number of samples, iterations, and runs.<br>
Question2.py<br>
this is a script that investigates the convergence of the  simulated area using the pure random sampling method.<br>
