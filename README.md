Visualization_of_Mandelbrot_set.py<br>
this is a script that provides a visualization of the mandel brotset<br>
Latin_hyper_cube.py<br>
this is a script to use the latin hyper cube method in finding the area of the mandelbrot set, including the variance, mean area, confidence interval at a given number of samples, iterations, and runs.<br>
Question2.py<br>
this is a script that investigates the convergence of the  simulated area using the pure random sampling method.<br>

Pure random sampling : Convergence of Mandelbrot set area estimation with itermax.py
Pure random sampling.py
Puer random sampling with error bars plotting.py
Convergence of Mandelbrot set area estimation in fct of the number of samples.py
This all refers to the question three for the pure random sampling method. 

Pure random vs antithetic sampling standard deviation comparaison.py
( This one was to compare the two methods based on the standard deviation, but it didn't give the expected results).

Pure Random sampling and antithetic : Estimation area.py
This refers to question 4.
