### contents:
-Mandelbrot.ipynb<br>
google colab notebook with code that was used, this is what should be read since it is more structured
Visualization_of_Mandelbrot_set.py<br>
this is a script that provides a visualization of the mandel brotset
Latin_hyper_cube.py<br>
this is a script to use the latin hyper cube method in finding the area of the mandelbrot set, including the variance, mean area, confidence interval at a given number of samples, iterations, and runs.<br>
Question2.py
this is a script that investigates the convergence of the  simulated area using the pure random sampling method.
OS.py<br> 
this is a script that finds the area of the mandelbrot set using orthogonal sampling
OS_stats.py<br>
for variance, mean area and confidence interval of OS-technique
Pure random sampling : Convergence of Mandelbrot set area estimation with itermax.py
Pure random sampling.py
Puer random sampling with error bars plotting.py
Convergence of Mandelbrot set area estimation in fct of the number of samples.py
This all refers to the question three for the pure random sampling method. <br>

Pure random vs antithetic sampling standard deviation comparaison.py
( This one was to compare the two methods based on the standard deviation, but it didn't give the expected results).<br>

Pure Random sampling and antithetic : Estimation area.py
This refers to question 4. <br>
