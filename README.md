this following repository has scripts to explore different sampling methods used to find the area of the mandelbrot set.
contents:
Visualization_of_Mandelbrot_set.py
this is a script that provides a visualization of the mandel brotset
Latin_hyper_cube.py
this is a script to use the latin hyper cube method in finding the area of the mandelbrot set, including the variance, mean area, confidence interval at a given number of samples, iterations, and runs.
Question2.py
this is a script that investigates the convergence of the  simulated area using the pure random sampling method.
